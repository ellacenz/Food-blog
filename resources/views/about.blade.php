        <blockquote class="p-5 ml-5 mr-5 font-italic">Hi, I’m Angela. Welcome to Oh She Glows – an award-winning recipe blog featuring over 500 healthy
            recipes (and growing)! For the past 6 years, I’ve shared energizing, 
            plant-based recipes that my family and I enjoy on a daily basis. 
            My goal is to inspire you to embrace more plant-based foods in your diet without 
            feeling the least bit deprived. And yes, my recipes are great for meat-eaters and 
            picky kids too! Most of my recipes are gluten-free 
            and many are allergy-friendly (just check the recipe for the allergy info).

            <h3> MY STORY:</h3>
            <p>
                On October 31st 2008, I started Oh She Glows to write about my recovery from an eating disorder,
                my journey to health, and the amazing transformation that food can make in our lives. 
                Within the first few months of blogging my readership started to grow and before long 
                I connected with women and men all over the world. Today, almost 7 years later, 
                Oh She Glows has over 1 million unique readers each month. I never expected that 
                my blog would turn into a passion and eventually my full-time career, 
                but I’m extremely grateful that I took a chance and hit publish on my first post.
            </p>
            <p>
                As my relationship with food improved, I focused on creating healthy plant-based recipes
                that would win over my husband’s approval. At the time, Eric was a devout fast-food lover 
                and drank pop like water. Coming up with healthy dishes that he enjoyed was a difficult task,
                but I was up for the challenge! I didn’t come from a food or photography background 
                (nope, I barely knew how to cook a potato), so everything you see on this blog is a 
                result of hard work and self-taught skill. I taught myself how to create recipes and then 
                photograph my creations. It’s been an adventure!
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2011, I was approached by an editor from a major publishing house
                and offered to write a cookbook. It had been a dream of mine for a while so I jumped at the opportunity. 
                my first cookbook was published on March 4, 2014. One year later, and it has over 300,000 copies
                in print! The response has been absolutely shocking…thrilling…mind-blowing. I’m so grateful that
                my work has resonated with so many across the world. The Oh She Glows Cookbook is now printed in 
                several different languages including English, Chinese, German, Slovak, and Spanish. 
                It’s sold across North America, the UK, Australia, and more.
